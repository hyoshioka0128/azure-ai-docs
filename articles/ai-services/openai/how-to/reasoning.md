# Azure OpenAI reasoning models

Azure OpenAI `o1` and `o1-mini` models are designed to tackle reasoning and problem-solving tasks with increased focus and capability. These models spend more time processing and understanding the user's request, making them exceptionally strong in areas like science, coding, and math compared to previous iterations.

**Key capabilities of the o1 series:**

- Complex Code Generation: Capable of generating algorithms and handling advanced coding tasks to support developers.
- Advanced Problem Solving: Ideal for comprehensive brainstorming sessions and addressing multifaceted challenges.
- Complex Document Comparison: Perfect for analyzing contracts, case files, or legal documents to identify subtle differences.
- Instruction Following and Workflow Management: Particularly effective for managing workflows requiring shorter contexts.

## Availability

The **o1 series** models are now available for API access and model deployment. **Registration is required, and access will be granted based on Microsoft's eligibility criteria**. Customers who previously applied and received access to `o1-preview`, don't need to reapply as they are automatically on the wait-list for the latest model.

Request access: [limited access model application](https://aka.ms/OAI/o1access)

Once access has been granted, you'll need to create a deployment for each model. If you have an existing `o1-preview` deployment, in-place upgrade is currently not supported, you'll need to create a new deployment.

### Region availability

| Model | Region |
|---|---|
|`o1` | East US2 (Global Standard) <br> Sweden Central (Global Standard) |
| `o1-preview` | See [models page](../concepts/models.md#global-standard-model-availability). |
| `o1-mini` | See [models page](../concepts/models.md#global-standard-model-availability). |

**o1 series** models will only work with the `max_completion_tokens` parameter.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is a known issue with the `o1` model and the `tool_choice` parameter. Currently function calls that include the optional `tool_choice` parameter will fail. This page will be updated once the issue is resolved.

### Not Supported

The following are currently unsupported with o1-series models:

- System Messages
- Streaming
- Parallel tool calling
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `logprobs`, `top_logprobs`, `logit_bias`, `max_tokens`

## Usage

These models [don't currently support the same set of parameters](#api--feature-support) as other models that use the chat completions API. 

# [Python (Microsoft Entra ID)](#tab/python-secure)

You'll need to upgrade your OpenAI client library for access to the latest parameters.

```cmd
pip install openai --upgrade
```

If you're new to using Microsoft Entra ID for authentication see [How to configure Azure OpenAI Service with Microsoft Entra ID authentication](../how-to/managed-identity.md).

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
)

client = AzureOpenAI(
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"), 
  azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
  api_version="2024-12-01-preview"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="o1-new", # replace with the model deployment name of your o1-preview, or o1-mini model
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What steps should I think about when writing my first Python API?"},
    ],
    max_completion_tokens = 5000

)

print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

# [Python (key-based auth)](#tab/python)

You might need to upgrade your version of the OpenAI Python library to take advantage of the new parameters like `max_completion_tokens`.

```cmd
pip install openai --upgrade
```

```python

from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"), 
  api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
  api_version="2024-12-01-preview"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="o1-new", # replace with the model deployment name of your o1 deployment.
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What steps should I think about when writing my first Python API?"},
    ],
    max_completion_tokens = 5000

)

print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

}

## Reasoning effort

> [!NOTE]
> Reasoning models have `reasoning_tokens` as part of `completion_tokens_details` in the model response. These are hidden tokens that aren't returned as part of the message response content but are used by the model to help generate a final answer to your request. `2024-12-01-preview` adds an additional new parameter `reasoning_effort` which can be set to `low`, `medium`, or `high` with the latest `o1` model. The higher the effort setting, the longer the model will spend processing the request, which will generally result in a larger number of `reasoning_tokens`.

## Developer messages

Functionally developer messages ` "role": "developer"` are the same as system messages.

- **System messages are not supported** with the **o1 series** reasoning models. 
- `o1-2024-12-17` with API version: `2024-12-01-preview` and later adds support for developer messages. 

Adding a developer message to the previous code example would look as follows:

# [Python (Microsoft Entra ID)](#tab/python-secure)

You'll need to upgrade your OpenAI client library for access to the latest parameters.

```cmd
pip install openai --upgrade
```

If you're new to using Microsoft Entra ID for authentication see [How to configure Azure OpenAI Service with Microsoft Entra ID authentication](../how-to/managed-identity.md).

```python
from openai import AzureOpenAI
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
)

client = AzureOpenAI(
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"), 
  azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
  api_version="2024-12-01-preview"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="o1-new", # replace with the model deployment name of your o1-preview, or o1-mini model
    messages=[
        {"role": "developer","content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, # optional equivalent to a system message for reasoning models 
        {"role": "user", "content": "What steps should I think about when writing my first Python API?"},
    ],
    max_completion_tokens = 5000

)

print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

# [Python (key-based auth)](#tab/python)

You might need to upgrade your version of the OpenAI Python library to take advantage of the new parameters like `max_completion_tokens`.

```cmd
pip install openai --upgrade
```

```python

from openai import AzureOpenAI

client = AzureOpenAI(
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"), 
  api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
  api_version="2024-12-01-preview"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="o1-new", # replace with the model deployment name of your o1 deployment.
    messages=[
        {"role": "developer","content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, # optional equivalent to a system message for reasoning models 
        {"role": "user", "content": "What steps should I think about when writing my first Python API?"},
    ],
    max_completion_tokens = 5000
)

print(response.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```
